    "the decision boundary is a linear function of the input. In other words, a (binary) linear\n",
    "classifier is a classifier that separates two classes using a line, a plane, or a hyperplane.\n",

    "There are many algorithms for learning linear models. These algorithms all differ in\n",

    "- for LogisticRegression and LinearSVC the trade off parameter that determines the strength of the regulrization is called C\n",
