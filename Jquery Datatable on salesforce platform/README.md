JQuery Integration with salesforce 

1. This component uses jQuery datatable 1.10.21, so make sure that is present in your static resoruces and all the other library which is present under static resources.
2. After adding this component to communties, make sure you provide the filed API names,Object Name, the header names for the same, wheather you want the date filter or not, if yes which field it should use.
3. Make sure your lightning locker is off as per now 1.10.21 version of jQuery datatable is not included in the lightning locker library.

Happy coding :)
